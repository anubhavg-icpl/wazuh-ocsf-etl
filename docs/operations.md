# Operations

## Service management

```bash
systemctl status wazuh-ocsf-etl
systemctl restart wazuh-ocsf-etl
journalctl -u wazuh-ocsf-etl -f
```

## Health checks

- Pipeline logs show regular flushes/rows
- ClickHouse ping endpoint responds `Ok.`
- State file offset moves as new alerts arrive

## Troubleshooting quick checks

### No data in ClickHouse

- Validate Wazuh is writing alerts
- Validate `.env` ClickHouse credentials/URL
- Check service user can read alerts file
- Confirm tables exist in target database

### Permission denied on alerts.json

Add service user to `wazuh` group, then restart service.

### Behind on backlog

Increase batching and verify ClickHouse performance:
- `BATCH_SIZE`
- `CHANNEL_CAP`
- `FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECS`

## Log rotation behavior

Handled automatically using inode and file-size checks.

- Rotation while running: reopens new file from 0
- Rotation while stopped: inode mismatch on startup triggers safe reset

## Upgrade

Recommended:

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo ./install.sh ./target/release/wazuh-ocsf-etl
systemctl start wazuh-ocsf-etl
```

Configuration and field mappings are preserved.
